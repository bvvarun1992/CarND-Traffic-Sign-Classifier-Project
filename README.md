## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

Overview
---
The main goal of this project is to implement a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs using TensorFlow. The model is trained and validated to classify the traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). The trained model is tested using random German traffic sign images downloaded from internet.


The Project
---
The steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the soft-max probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report


Folder Structure
---
* The file `Main.py` contains the code to load the data, train and evaluate the model and test it on five random images of traffic signs downloaded from web.
* German traffic dataset is stored in folder `./traffic_signs_data/`
* Images downloaded from web are stored in `./web_images/`
