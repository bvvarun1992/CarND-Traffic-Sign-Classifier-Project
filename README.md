## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

Overview
---
The main goal of this project is to implement a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs. The model is trained and validated to classify the traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). The trained model is tested using random German traffic sign images downloaded from internet.


The Project
---
The steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

Folder Structure
---
* Traffic_sign_Classifier.ipynb is a jupyter notebook containing the above mentioned steps followed to build the neural network.
* German traffic dataset is stored in folder ./traffic_signs_data
